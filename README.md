This project aims to develop a job searching website that connects job seekers with companies.
Job seekers can search for desired jobs, while companies can post job openings. A unique
feature of this platform is an MCQ-based assessment that job seekers must pass with at least
70% marks before applying for a job. If they fail, the system suggests relevant courses to
improve their skills.
